 *
 *	Description          : Only asynchronous notifications can be routed over any sort of out of process
 *	                     : bridge - INotification is good for in process - but once out of process the
 *	                     : return status has a different meaning - namely that it indicates whether the
 *	                     : notification processing has been dispatched - rather than the status return
 *	                     : from an individual recipient

/**
* Asynchronous notifications can be routed over a bridge, however unlike
* the inprocess notifications the Transmit method will return Indeterminate as
* the status cannot be know.
* The model for Asynchronous notifications is different - they can be notify only
* or result in a return AsynchronousNotification that is the result of the incoming notification
* that will be received by an incoming bridge and dispatched. Matching of outgoing/incoming is via
* the UniqueID - however this isn't a recommended design - it is much better to design the Notifications
* such that the Outgoing results in an Incoming that is handled seperately.
* e.g. for User Authentication
* 1. Transmit UserAuthenticationRequest
* 2. ReciptStatus indeterminate (sent out)
* 3. (Later on) UserAuthenticationRespose received via bridge
* 4. Handle UserAuthenticationRespose - probably within the same class that made the request
* in the Receive method.
